# QHMscraper
A project to scrape the next day's movements in and out of Portsmouth Harbour by the Royal Navy

# Intention
To automate checking of departing and arriving vessels, and send a push notifcation to a user which returns the name, location, and time of the arrival/departure for the next day
Doing so makes it easier than checking the site manually every morning
